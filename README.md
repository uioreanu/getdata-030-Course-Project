Course Project

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

Calin Uioreanu 2015-07-21

#Tasks description


The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis for the project Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. Steps required: 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###run_analysis.R

The script (run_analysis.R) does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
